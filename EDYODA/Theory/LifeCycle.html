 Life cycle methods when :
<!-- 
1.When comp is loaded
2.when comp is updated with state and props
3.when comp is removed
 -->

Lifecycle of Components:
<!-- 
Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
The three phases are: Mounting(load component:componentDidMount) ,Updating(pass state,props, something change in component in componenet:componentDidUpdate), and Unmounting(remove /hide from dom:componentWillUnmount).
-->
_______________________________________________________________
1.Mounting
<!-- Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

constructor()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them. -->
***(i)constructor
 <!-- when class is created then constructor will call immediately.
     when we make the component frist make constructor 
     The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values. --> 
***(ii)getDerivedStateFromProps()
<!-- The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state -->

***(iii)render()
<!-- It is present in only class components .not in functional components.
--all html write here only.
The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM. 
--any state updated render re-render automatically.
with render class comp didnt work.

-->

***(iv)componentDidMount()******
<!-- 
 html,css ,dom is ready then called.  
 componentDidMount() used to API calls. 
 no effect of state and props.
The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.

This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM. -->

_______________________________________________________________
2.Updating
<!-- The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.

A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
 componentDidUpdate()
The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them. -->
****componentDidUpdate:
<!-- The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM. 
--you want to perform events any state used this.
only rrun after state/props is change .It is call each time call when state upadated
-->
****shouldComponentUpdate():
<!-- we use conditions here,this method ask us can i update or not .
    --states or propes updated when it works
  it blocks rendering itself.it bydefault behavior <-


-->
_______________________________________________________________
3.Unmounting:
<!-- The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.

React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:

componentWillUnmount()
-->
*****componentWillUnmount
<!-- The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM. 
--hide and show component then the comp is remove from dom.
-->
