Redux
<!-- 
--a container where u can store your whole application data.
--we call it to state management.
It doesn't belong to component state.
like array to store data. it is in frontend.

 -->
 Why we need Redux:
 <!-- communication between components is easily managed by using redux. -->

 Redux Architecture:
 View: 
 <!-- (eg-buttons,checkbox,input box),which is show us on browser.we write this is in react    component. -->

 Action:
 <!-- collect data from component or API(when we perform action on buttons)
--data comes from view or through API
-->

 Reducer:
 <!-- Get data from action and send to store -->
 Store:
 <!-- state of complete application
    complete user data store here.when need then send to view.

-->
*********One redux:one Store alws************
<!-- data alws unidirectional. -->
___________________________________________________
INSTALLATION:
npm -v
node -v
npm install redux
npm install react-redux
_____________________________________________________________
transfer data from one comp to onother comp use props.
___________________________________________________
props:
<!-- 
import React from "react";
const User = (props) => {
  const { data } = props;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>User Comp</h1>
      <h4>{data.name}</h4>
      <h4>{data.email
      }</h4>
    </div>
  );
};
export default User; -->
App.js
<!-- 
import User from "./User";
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <User data={{ name: "Manisha", email: "manu@gmail.com" }} />
    </div>
  );
} -->
__________________________________________________________
Folder Structure:
<!-- 
1.components:
2.container:redux and react connect(component and services connected here)
3.service: all redux here
Actions:
reducers:
 -rootReducer:combines all reducers files here.
constants:which data match in action and reducer that tell us contants. 
-->
___________________________________________________when we use redux then we components with containers .dont directly use components.
<!-- Home.js==>homeContainer.js==>App.js -->
---------------------------------------------
Action:
<!-- action sends data fro  react component  to redux store.

-->
 contants file- <!-- same file used in action and reducer. -->
REDUCER:
<!-- data from actions it send to store.reducer filterout data and sebd to store.
-->
-rootReducer:
<!-- all reducers merge in single reducer that we can store in one place. -->
container:
<!-- redux and react connected in container.


-->
mapDispachToPrpos:
<!-- component to redux store data send then use mapDispachToPrpos. -->
mapStateToPrpos:
<!-- redux store data  to send 3rd party . -->
